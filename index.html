        <p>
          <em>Technological Empathy</em> is the ability to understand what happens when you open or create a web page.
          <br>
          (1) Have a basic understanding of how the Internet works.
          <br>
          (2) Have an understanding of how users, computers, servers, HTTP, and the Internet fit together.

        The Basics of the Web
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          There are 5 basic components to understand about the web:
          <br>
          The <em>World Wide Web (WWW)</em> - (1) HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) or hyperlinks that connect the web; invented in the early 1990's.
          <br>
          Major pieces of the web also include: (2) You, (3) your computer/browser, (4) the internet, (5) and servers.

        HTML - Hypertext Markup Language
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          <b>HTML (or Hypertext Markup Language)</b> is made up of:
          <br>
          (1) Text Content = what you see
          <br>
          (2) Mark Up = what it looks like
          <br>
          (3) References to other documents (e.g videos and images like this one - <img src="http://www.udacity.com/cs253x/hipmunk.png" alt="hipmunk">)
          <br>
          (4) Links to other pages
          <br>
          <br>
          <em>There are also a variety of attributes that can be added to HTML to further enchance the web page.</em>
          <br>
          <br>
          The <em>"a href" tag</em> is used to link other webpages to yours.  It can be used to link sites like <a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> or <a href="http://www.cnn.com">CNN</a>.
          <br>
          <br>
          Images can also be added using the <em>"img" tag</em>.
          <br>
          <br>
          <em>Note: the use of img tags do not require a closing tag.</em>
          <br>
          <br>
          You can also use Google as a resource to add links in HTML since it's impossible to remember everything!

        Whitespace, Inline, and Block Elements
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          The use and understanding of <b>whitespace</b> is important - it allows you to place text on multiple lines.
          <br>
          <br>
          Two types of elements to understand are <b>Inline</b> and <b>Block</b> elements:
          <br>
          (1) <em>Inline</em> - Examples of Inline elements include the use of the following tags: b, em, img, br, and span
          <br>
          (2) <em>Block</em> - Examples of Block elements include the use of the following tags: p and div
          <br>
          **<b>Inline</b> tags behave differently from <em>Block</em> tags; <em>Block</em> elements can add height and width to a web page.

          (1) Overview of the Internet - servers, browsers, the Internet, HTTP
          <br>
          (2) Intro to HTML - tags, inline vs. block
          <br>
          <br>
          1.  What a web page is - a text document written in HTML; web browsers read them then intrepret and display them
          <br>
          2.  How coding works - coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand
          <br>
          3.  Computers are <em>stupid</em> - programmers need to write <em><b>exactly</b></em> the way a computer understands (writing with the correct syntax)
          <br>
          4.  Programmers can't remember everything - just look up what you can't remember - use Google!
          <br>
          5.  Understand basic HTML vocabulary
          <br>
          <br>
          <em>Tags</em>
          <br>
          - An HTML tag is contained within angled brackets
          <br>
          -  Most tags have an opening and closing tag
          <br>
          -  Some tags are void or do not require a closing tag - i.e. the "br" tag
          <br>
          <br>
          <em>Element</em> - an HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
          <br>
          <br>
          <em>Attribute</em> - this is a property of an HTML element (i.e. - to set the HREF attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL you would write <em>a href="http://www.udacity.com"</em>)
          <br>
          <br>
          <em><b>SUMMARY:</b></em>
          <br>
           1.  HTML and CSS are both "languages".
          <br>
          2.  HTML controls the "structure" of the web
          <br>
          3.  CSS controls the "style" of a page (how it looks).
          <br>
          4.  When programmers talk about the "DOM" (Document Object Model) they are talking about the tree-like structure of a page.
          <br>
          5.  HTML and CSS are both languages with their own syntax and rules.
          <br>
          6.  CSS uses syntax and rules to define how to see elements on a page.
          <br>
          7.  The better one can "boxify" and think in terms of "boxing" to organize a page, the better and easier it will be to code.

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is code written to control the "style" of HTML elements.  There are three ways to write CSS code into files:
          <br>
          1.  Written into the HTML head code itself (not good)
          <br>
          2.  Link HTML to a separate CSS file (good)
          <br>
          3.  Write your style inline with your HTML (not good)
          <br>

        Box Sizing
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Four important things to consider when box sizing CSS:
          <br>
          1.  HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components
          <br>
          2.  Because there are so many components to each box, it can often be hard to get the size of a box just right.
          <br>
          3.  2 techniques you can use to deal with sizing issues:
          <br>
            (i) Set the sizes in terms of percentages rather than pixels
            <br>
            (ii) Set the box-sizing attribute to border-box for every element
            <br>
            <br>
          ** Note - Different browsers work slightly differently.  Sometimes this cuases different browsers to display code differently.

        Box Repositioning
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          1.  DIVs are block elements (as opposed to inline) so by default they take up the entire width of a page.
          <br>
          2.  Adding particular rules to the appropriate CSS will override this behavior and let DIVs appear next to each other.

          1.  Look for natural boxes
          <br>
          2.  Look for repeated styles and semantic elements
          <br>
          3.  Write your HTML
          <br>
          4.  Apply Styles (from biggest to smallest)
          <br>
          5.  Fix things!
